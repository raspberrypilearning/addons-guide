# The SenseHAT

The SenseHAT was designed and created for the [AstroPi project](https://astro-pi.org/).
You can purchase a SenseHAT from [RS Components](http://uk.rs-online.com/web/p/interface-development-kits/8949310/) and [CPC](https://cpc.farnell.com/raspberry-pi/raspberrypi-sensehat/add-on-board-sense-hat-for-raspberry/dp/SC13930?COM=main-search%20CMPNULL).

The SenseHAT is packed full of sensors, including:

- Gyroscope, to measure the orientation of the SenseHAT
- Accelerometer, to measure the acceleration of the SenseHAT
- Magnetometer, to measure the Earth's magnetic field
- Temperature, to measure the atmospheric temperature
- Barometric pressure, to measure the atmospheric pressure
- Humidity, to measure percentage water saturation of the air

There is also a small joystick on the SenseHAT, and a large 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix.

The SenseHAT is added to the Raspberry Pi using the rows of GPIO pins. Simply place the SenseHAT onto the Raspberry Pi, making sure the pins allign.

If you have a SenseHAT then our [Getting Started with the SenseHAT](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-the-sense-hat/) guide is the best place to start. There are also resources showing you how to make [a reaction timer game in Scratch](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/astronaut-reaction-times/), a [marble maze in Python](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sense-hat-marble-maze/) and crazy [random sparkles](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/sense-hat-random-sparkles/), as well as many more.
