The SenseHAT is packed full of sensors, including:

- Gyroscope, to measure the orientation of the SenseHAT
- Accelerometer, to measure the acceleration of the SenseHAT
- Magnetometer, to measure the Earth's magnetic field
- Temperature, to measure the atmospheric temperature
- Barometric pressure, to measure the atmospheric pressure
- Humidity, to measure percentage water saturation of the air.

There is also a small joystick on the SenseHAT, and a large 8Ã—8 RGB LED matrix.
